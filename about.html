        <h6>Introduction!üòÄ</h6>
        <p>G'day my name is Laura, I am 28 and live in Far North Queensland, Australia and I have found a serious
            passion
            with the amazing, challenging and techinqical world of coding!
        </p>
        </br>
        </br>
        <h6>How did I get into coding?üë©‚Äçüíª</h6>
        <p>
            Over the last 12 years I have been given plenty of opportunities to work within many different industries in
            multiple different roles. However, unfortunately I have never been able to forfill the urge for something
            more
            within my career.
            </br>
            In 2019, I married my bestfriend Sean and spent a year working and travelling all around queensland before
            coming
            back to Cairns. Shortly after, we were blessed with our first baby boy, Roman, born November 2021.
            During my time on materity leave, I still had this overwhelming emotion that while I loved the job I was in,
            I
            really didnt want to go back. While searching for alternative options I found a company advertising free 1hr
            session workshop for coding. Believe me when I say, I had no idea what was involved with coding or web
            development
            but decided to take the free class. After the class I felt excited and encouraged to step out of my comfort
            zone
            and
            try something I never thought I would ever be able to do. I signed up for the entire course and have spent
            the
            last
            year educating myself.
        </p>
        </br>
        </br>
        <h6>A litte career backgroundüìù</h6>
        <p>
            I completed my school years here in Cairns and started working within retail. After I graduated year 12, I
            had
            no
            idea what I wanted to do, so decided to futher my education within Business. I completed my business Cert 3
            and
            got
            my first administrative role. I have since worked in many administrative roles such as receptionist,
            personal
            assistant, valuation coordinator, marketing, Social media coordinator, purchasing officer and even General
            Manager.
            While working within these roles I have always pushed myself to progress as far as I can go before feeling a
            certain
            unforfilment and then searching for the next opportunity to excel and educate myself. Since this had been a
            reoccuring pattern for me I relised it was time to search for something more!
        </p>
        </br>
        </br>
        <h6>The Future and my goals!ü§©</h6>
        <p>
            Since falling in love with the world of coding and all the incredible options within this industry, from
            here I
            would like to look at applying for a few different roles and take any opportunity offered to me and then
            continue to
            grow my
            skills and education. A long term goal would be to become well educated and highly skilled within many roles
            and
            be
            able to support
            others on there journey too. I love to travel so the ability to work from all over the world excites me even
            more!
